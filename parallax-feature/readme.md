# Parallax Feature for The Clubhouse's Code Bootcamp

- Point of this exercise is to convert the jquery file into vanilla JS

[My basic solution is on Codepen](https://codepen.io/sbraun/pen/dedxqe);

##### Just to name a few problems I did not solve
1. Responsiveness
2. Multiple parallax imagees
3. variable height
